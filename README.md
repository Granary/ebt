This repository contains work in progress for Serhei Makarov's 2014 USRA, building an event-based instrumentation language for use with Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) frameworks such as [Granary](https://github.com/Granary/granary) or [DynamoRIO](http://www.dynamorio.org/). The overall design mimics languages such as [SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/) or [DTrace](http://dtrace.org/blogs/), but with additional features taking advantage of the capabilities of a DBT system.

You may also be interested in the [references](doc/refs.md) for my poster at PACT 2014.
