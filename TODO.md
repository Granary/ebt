# Outline of Tasks for Granary+ Support

If my schedule of DynamoRIO-based work (outlined in the previous section) proceeds well, I will try to work on Granary+ quickly enough to include it in the corresponding upcoming papers.

| Patch | Estimated Date | Completed |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| sample Granary client collection | | |
| (decoupling work for EBT library / implement more stuff directly in EBT) | | |
| basic Granary/C++ backend and event mechanism implementation | | |
| mapping of high-level EBT events to event mechanisms | | |
| look into additional functionality that uses Granary+ | | |
